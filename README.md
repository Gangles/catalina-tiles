Catalina Tiles
====================================

Catalina Tiles was created for the exercise “Luck Tac Toe” in Chapter 5 of Challenges for Game Designers by Brenda Brathwaite & Ian Schreiber. The challenge given was to “modify [Tic-Tac-Toe] by adding one or more chance- based mechanics”. The game should also be “good for adult players”.
